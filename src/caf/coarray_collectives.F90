  !! This version of a prefix sum implements a "work-efficient" algorithm [1,2]
  !! that requires 2 log2 N - 2 (sequential) steps, but only twice the work of
  !! the sequential algorithm. Here "work" is the summing of two numbers, one
  !! of which is read from another image. Thus this parallel algorithm is very
  !! efficient compared to other parallel algorithms with respect to the amount
  !! of remote communication. This algorithm also presents a very interesting
  !! exercise/challenge in the use of SYNC IMAGES.
